📊 Gold & Financial Market Econometric Analysis (R)
📌 Overview

This project performs comprehensive financial time series and econometric analysis on Gold and related market indices using R. It integrates statistical testing, regression modeling, dimensionality reduction, seasonal decomposition, and ARIMA forecasting to evaluate price dynamics, market relationships, and predictive performance.

The project demonstrates applied econometrics, hypothesis testing, and time series modeling using real-world financial data.

📊 Analytical Components
🔹 Price Elasticity

Calculates log-differenced elasticity between EU_Price and Volume to measure price responsiveness.

🔹 Granger Causality Test

Evaluates whether SP_open statistically predicts EU_Price using lag-based causality testing.

🔹 Event Impact Analysis

Uses regression modeling to assess the influence of a specified time-period event on gold prices.

🔹 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduces dimensionality of correlated financial indices (SP_open, DJ_open, EG_open, etc.) to identify dominant variance components.

🔹 Seasonal Decomposition

Decomposes the gold price time series into trend, seasonal, and irregular components.

🔹 Regression Modeling

Builds a linear regression model to predict closing prices using Open, High, Low, and Volume.

🔹 ARIMA Forecasting

Applies auto.arima() to generate short-term forecasts and compares time series predictions with regression outputs.
